# Status

- Version: `0.4.0`.
- Scope: map-first v1 UX refactor (breaking), drawer-based workflows, layers panel controls, 3D tooltip/terminator band, and refreshed CI/e2e/gh-pages coverage.
- Verification gates:
  - `npm run format:check`
  - `npm run lint`
  - `npm run typecheck`
  - `npm run test`
  - `npm run build`
  - `npm run perf:report`
  - `npm run test:e2e`
  - `npm run test:e2e:gh-pages`
  - `npm run ui:capture`
- AoE: supported as `Anywhere on Earth (AoE, UTC-12)` mapped to `Etc/GMT+12`.
- 2D map: infinite horizontal wrap, zoom/pan/reset, now+deadline visualization.
- 3D globe: `react-globe.gl` with hover civil/solar/delta tooltip, cursor-oriented dolly zoom, and visible solar/terminator paths.
- Detail lens: MapLibre raster lens controlled from layers (`auto|off|on`) with minimal overlay UI.
- Layout: full-screen map-first shell with only deadline chip, mode cluster, layers button, and countdown HUD always visible.
- Deadline safety: slot manager + draft/apply/discard + slot lock to prevent accidental overwrites.
- Debug tooling: overlap detector + screenshot/layout export.
- GH-pages safety: base-path aware build + runtime asset probes + CI subpath smoke tests.
- Docs/screens safety: deterministic `?demo=1&capture=1` baseline + CI screenshot drift gate with tight pixel tolerance.
- Known gap: timezone polygon data is still optional to avoid default ODbL payload coupling.
