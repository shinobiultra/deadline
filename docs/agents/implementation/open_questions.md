# Open Questions

- Should civil highlighting be exact minute match only or always include a glow tolerance?
- Do we ship timezone polygons in-repo or keep them as optional downloadable pack?
- Should browser notifications remain opt-in only with explicit settings gate? (current behavior: yes)
- Should deadline slots support explicit delete/reorder actions, or keep only add/duplicate/switch for v1 simplicity?
- For detail zoom, do we keep OpenStreetMap raster only, or add optional vector/building extrusion mode (payload/perf tradeoff)?
